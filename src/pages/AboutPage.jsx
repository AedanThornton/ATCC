      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>This is a fan-made card library (and more coming soon!) made with React. It is open source and can be found on my GitHub.</p>
      <p>The idea is to have an all-inclusive place to reference cards for the Aeon Trespass games for recreational purposes.</p>
      <p>This site is owned and managed by Artifus (Aedan Thornton). Image assets are recreations by me of the originals, using Inkscape. Originals are owned by Into the Unknown Studios.</p>
